                    <h2>What are Algorithms in Computer Science?</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        Algorithms are a process of steps to solve a
                problem. Believe it or not; we use Algorithms
                everyday in our lives! For instance we use it 
                everytime we do math. Let's say we have a math 
                equation -> 2*(x+5) - 3 = 4. First we multiply 
                two times x plus five. <strong>2*(x+5)</strong>-3 = 4. 
                After simplifying the equation would look like
                this ->2x + 10 - 3 = 4. After that we would subtract
                10 by 3, 2x +<strong>10 - 3</strong> = 4. Then we 
                would have the equation as 2x + 7 = 4, now we would 
                subtract 7 on both sides, resulting in this -> 
                2x = -3. Lastly we would divide 2 on both sides 
                which means x = -3/2 or x = -1.5. <br/>
                All those steps from the problem we
                did was an <strong>algorithm</strong>. These
                type of Algorithms are used so much in our
                life that we don't even notice it! Algorithms
                are also very important in Computer Science.
                Especially when a problem asks you to do something.
                This something can be anything. And when we code
                we write the <strong>steps</strong> down to solve
                the problem! Down below is another example of an algorithm.

                    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        If you don't know what time complexity, here is a
                    brief explanation. Time complexity is the duration
                    of time taken for an algorithm to run. We use the notation
                    Big O, this a tool used to describe the time complexity 
                    of different Algorithms. For example in the code below, all we
                    are doing is looping through the list and printing the elements
                    which means the time complexity would be linear.

                    <h2>Binary Search Algorithm</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        Anyways, there is another algorithm which I want to
                    show you, which is the <strong>Binary Search Algorithm!</strong>.
                    It might look very complicated but when I finish explaining
                    it will look really easy. So when to use Binary Search
                    Algorithm. It would be the exact same case as the linear
                    search Algorithm or when you need to find a designated
                    element in an array. But when you use it; you should always have a 
                    sorted array (descending to ascending integers) or sort the
                    array beforehand. Alright, let's get into it! Let's say your array
                    is this -> <strong>[2, 6, 7, 12, 17, 24, 26]</strong>. And let's say your designated
                    element is <strong>26</strong>. First you would check the middle
                    element and compare 26 with it. Since 26 > 12, you will move onto
                    the elements [17,24,26]. Now the new middle element is 24. You will
                    compare once again 26 with 24. Since 26 > 24, there is only one element 
                    we can check. [26] is middle element because it is the only element
                    we have to check. Now when we compare 26 with 26, we see that 
                    we have found the designated element. The time complexity of 
                    Binary Search Algorithm is <strong>O(log(n))</strong>, which is
                    much better than <strong>O(n)</strong>.

                    <h2>For and While Loops</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        What is a loop? Loop can be used to repeat specific instructions for a known number
                        of times. The two types of loop we use in python are <strong>For</strong> and <strong>While</strong>
                        loops. The <strong>for</strong>loop is used to repeat a block of
                        code known number of times. Whereas a <strong>while</strong>loop is repeated until a 
                        specific condition is met.
